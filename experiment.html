    <h3>Materials</h3>
	
		<li>Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Tablet</li></br>
		<li>HP Business Black USB Keyboard</li></br>
		<li>Typing measurement website (Key Hero)</li></br>
		<li>Monitor (Philips Brilliance 241B)</li></br>
		<li>Desk</li></br>
		<li>Chair</li></br>
	
	
	<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
	
	<p> We think that the membrane keyboard will provide both a faster time and more accurate typing. We believe this to be
	the case as people are more accustomed to the physical touch of a keyboard over a just a basic haptical touch of a
	touch screen keyboard. Not only this, but with a normal keyboard all functionality is already infront of you, 
	whereas with a touch screen, you need to change to a different keyboard to get access to other keys that would
	normally be readily available.</p>
	
	<h3>Independent Variables</h3>
	
	<h4>Surface Pro 4</h4>
	<p>We chose the surface to test our touch screen typing results as we already have the device readily available
	to us. This will need to be controlled as different types of touch screen devices will have different response
	times, meaning they could yield different results when it comes to speed an accuracy.</p>
	
	<h4>Membrane Keyboard</h4>
	<p>The membrane keyboard we will be using will be the basic AUT keyboard available in most labs. This will need
	to be controlled as again, every keyboard has a response time between when a key is pressed and the action is
	performed.</p>
	
	<h3>Dependent Variables</h3>
	
	<h4>Typing Speed</h4>
	<p>We will be measuring the typing speed of our participants in order to gain an understanding on how
	our haptics have an effect on typing speed.</p>
	
	<h4>Typing Accuracy</h4>
	<p>We will also be measuring how accurate our participants are with each of the keyboards
in order to gain a deeper understanding about how our haptics affect our perception of they equipment that we use.</p>
	
	<h3>Controlled Variables</h3>
	
	<h4>Monitor</h4>
	<p>The monitor will be an important factor and must be controlled. Every monitor has a different response time,
	   this will mean that we need to ensure the same model of monitor will be used.</p>
	
	<h4>Key Hero</h4>
	<p>Key hero is the website that we will be using to test our participants. We chose this website as it allows us
	to input our own custom text so that we can ensure the same text is being used for testing. This website also
	needs to be controlled as another site could end with a different result being obtained.</p>
	
	<h4>Desk</h4>
	<p>We will need a desk as we will need to be able to have the monitor sit at eye level to make it easier for our
	participants. The desks used will be the general computer desks in WZ701, so that everyone will be using the
	same equipment.</p>
	
	<h4>Chair</h4>

	<p>The chair we will be using will be the chairs in the WZ701 Lab. We will allow willing participants to change the
	height and position of the chair so that they will be able to view the screen and type more comfortably, to achieve
	their best results.</p>
	
	<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Pull up the Key Hero website and insert the chosen text.</li>
		<li>Seat the participant in the chair.</li>
		<li>Allow the participant to adjust the position of the keyboard or their chair to get comfortable.</li>
		<li>Allow the participant to begin the typing test when they're ready.</li>
		<li>Record the results.</li>
		<li>Repeat the test another two times to ensure accuracy, recording results after every completion.</li>
		<li>Once the participant has completed their tests on the keyboard, exchange the keyboard for a surface.</li>
		<li>Direct the participant to the key hero website and again, and insert the chosen text.</li>
		<li>Allow the participant to begin the typing test when they're ready.</li>
		<li>Record the results.</li>
		<li>Repeat the test another two times to ensure accuracy, recording results after every completion.</li>
		<li>The participant is now free to leave.</li>
	</ol>
