    <p>Our results show that it seems the standard keyboard is better in almost every way, thus proving our hypothesis correct.
      The average typing speed was much higher than people typing on a Surface. However, it can be noted that generally speaking
      most participants had a Surface typing speed that was about half the speed of the keyboard (with some exceptions).<br>
      <br>In terms of accuracy, in most cases the keyboard was again superior, but in comparison to the differences in speed, not by as much.
       It seems that people typing on a Surface can maneuver the Surface keyboard with almost the same accuracy as if they were typing on a
       standard keyboard. However, a lot of these results could be tilted in favour of the keyboard, as all our test subjects were Compsci
       students, all of them have more experience with using a keyboard than using a Surface touch screen keyboard, meaning they all feel
       generally more comfortable on a standard keyboard.
