  <div class="w3-container">

    <p>As our results have proven our hypothesis correct, it does seem that the standard keyboard is the way to go for everyone.<br>
      <br>Thinking back a little bit, the ability to diversify the testing pool a little bit more may not have been a bad idea.
      This would have given us the ability to test students from other degrees, this could result in people feeling a little bit more
       comfortable with a tablet keyboard over a standard one. We could have also done multiple tests with the same people, to see if
       they could improve on their previous result, they could just have needed the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the device
       first before they went and tested it.<br>
      <br>None of our participants had any issues with the way our tests were presented or conducted. It does seem however that although
      the standard keyboard is the clear winner here, people are slowly becoming more accustomed to touch screen keyboards, one participant
      had the exact same accuracy from both keyboards. For now however, standard keyboards are still the way forward.
