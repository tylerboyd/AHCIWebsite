How wide are the horizons of the spinning earth! The moonlight leads the tides and the sun's light will not be confined within the net of heaven, 
but in the end all things return to the One. The deaf and the dumb, the crippled and deformed are all restored to One's perfection.

of glory in the flower; we will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind.

When you go on the run, the first thing you do is lay down tracks in the opposite direction, 
but that only works if the bad guys find the trail and believe it's for real, which means selling it. You need to put on a show, make them feel clever.

And it is only when we are faced with failure do we realize that these resources were always within us. 
We only need to find them and move on with our lives.
