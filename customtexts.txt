How wide are the horizons of the spinning earth! The moonlight leads the tides and the sun's light will not be confined within the net of heaven,
but in the end all things return to the One. The deaf and the dumb, the crippled and deformed are all restored to One's perfection.



What though the radiance which was once so bright be now for ever taken from my sight; though nothing can bring back the hour of splendour in the grass,
of glory in the flower; we will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind.



I crave you in the most innocent form. I crave to say good night and give your forehead kisses and to say that I adore you when you feel at your worst.
I crave you in ways where I just want to be next to you and nothing more or less.



When you go on the run, the first thing you do is lay down tracks in the opposite direction,
but that only works if the bad guys find the trail and believe it's for real, which means selling it. You need to put on a show, make them feel clever.
When you make somebody work to get a piece of information they'll believe it that much more because it's hard to get.



When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.



When we tackle obstacles, we find hidden reserves of courage and resilience we did not know we had.
And it is only when we are faced with failure do we realize that these resources were always within us.
We only need to find them and move on with our lives.



I am a human made of cells, which are made of molecules, which are made of atoms, which are made of up quarks and down quarks and gluons.
This is what makes me question the credence of my emotions. If the soul exists separately from the corporeal,
why are my emotions just chemicals and signals being sent from one part of my body to another?
Is the love I occasionally feel just the result of my physical self willing my mental self into reproducing? I do not wish to pursue a chemical romance.
