    <h4>Tyler Boyd - 16951977</h4>
    <p>	I am currently in my third year of undergraduate study, working towards completing a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science majoring in Software Development.
		This paper has introduced me to a lot of new concepts that change the way I perceive my own interaction with computers.
		In this project, I learned how to properly conduct a usability test, and how to draw useful conclusions from it. I now feel like I have a solid understanding of why good usability is so important in technology.
		In a job such as Software development, having good typing speed and accuracy can increase the rate you work at drastically. As technology evolves, touch screen tablets such as the surface tablet used in
		our experiment are becoming increasingly common in both educational and workplace environments. Because of this, it is vital that touch screen tablets and other devices have good usability. In our experiment, a standard
		physical keyboard performed better on average than the touchscreen keyboard in both typing speed and accuracy. This evidently shows that a physical keyboard is easier to use than a touch screen keyboard. This confirmed
		my hypothesis from before the experiment was conducted. </br>
		Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working on this project and in this team.

    <h4>Tarran O'Shaughnessy - 16951982</h4>
    <p>During my time with this project, I’ve managed to expand my knowledge on Human-Computer Interaction. Learning about how individual
      devices have an effect on basic haptic perception. In our case, the effect of using a standard keyboard versus a touch pad keyboard
      has given me an opportunity to learn that even though the layout is the same, the size and the ability to actually have a physical
      impact on a keyboard seems to have a direct effect on the speed of a user. Personally, I use a mechanical keyboard at home, and I
      feel more comfortable using that than a touch screen keyboard.<br>
      <br>I feel like we could have improved our research a little bit. I think we didn’t really have a big enough test pool, meaning our
      results could be scrutinized a little bit. I also think that we should’ve chosen some people who aren’t studying BCIS to complete the test,
      it might have been a better way to diversify our pool a little bit.<br>
      <br>My tasks during the project were to do most of the write up, meaning I wrote our methodology, variables, conclusion Etc. I also ensured
      that we had our documentation for getting participants to sign off on our ability to be able to use the data in whatever way we wanted. I also
      found the software that we would use in order to conduct our research.<br>
      <br>Every member of the team was a pleasure to work with, everyone showed up to meetings and everyone had input on the direction of our research.
       Everyone has been more than willing to help each other out and complete their tasks on time without any issue.<br>
      <br>Once I complete my degree as a software developer, learning about what keyboard is more suitable will help me understand what will allow me to
      be more productive when I go out to join the workforce. This project has given me some insight on how my knowledge fairs when it comes to
      statistical analysis, I struggled a little bit writing the conclusion more so in the way of writing a comprehensive analysis of what the
      results actually displayed. Due to this I’ve gained at least a little bit of knowledge on how to analyse and respond to hard data.
      Due to how good my team is and how well everyone worked together, I thoroughly enjoyed this project and its success.

    <p>In this assessment, our team are trying to figure out are Surface virtual keyboard and standard keyboard have the likely result when people are typing the same content. During the experiment, all of the experimenter is coming from AUT who is learning BCIS.
		One of difficulty is: it is hard to know is the handedness has any effect in our experiment. In real world, most people are right-handed. Hence, all the experimenter is right-handed in our experiment.
		After the experiment, I learned compare with Surface virtual keyboard most people can type much quicker on the standard keyboard. In our experiment, we want our experimenter to have some basic typing skills, not a typing master or a layman. This would make data more dependable.
		Afterall, I'm really enjoy choosing this project in this semester. As a software student, I can bring all I learned into another class called research and development. It is my pleasure to join in this team, the other three team members help me a lot. This is an enjoyable project.</p>


    <h4>Chad Gilchrist - 14865134</h4>
    <p>I am currently in my third year, I am studying a Bachelor of Computer and information science majoring in software development.
      This paper opened my eyes and showed me a lot more than I was expecting at the beginning this paper has also taught me a lot and I will look forward to
      using this in the research and development paper I am starting next semester. My role in the project was to help run the experiment and prepare the displaying of the results on a website.
      This was a cool twist as I’m looking at going into the web development side. Our experiment is a very basic but essential experiment because of people in the workplace of where
      I will end up using both touch screen and membrane keyboards. The membrane keyboard performed better than the touch screen which confirmed our hypothesis.
      This paper was fun, and I enjoyed working as a team and displaying our results on a website instead of the standard word document.</p>
