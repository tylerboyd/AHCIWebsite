    <p>	I am currently in my third year of undergraduate study, working towards completing a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science majoring in Software Development. 
		This paper has introduced me to a lot of new concepts that change the way I perceive my own interaction with computers.
		In this project, I learned how to properly conduct a usability test, and how to draw useful conclusions from it. I now feel like I have a solid understanding of why good usability is so important in technology.
		In a job such as Software development, having good typing speed and accuracy can increase the rate you work at drastically. As technology evolves, touch screen tablets such as the surface tablet used in 
		our experiment are becoming increasingly common in both educational and workplace environments. Because of this, it is vital that touch screen tablets and other devices have good usability. In our experiment, a standard
		physical keyboard performed better on average than the touchscreen keyboard in both typing speed and accuracy. This evidently shows that a physical keyboard is easier to use than a touch screen keyboard. This confirmed
		my hypothesis from before the experiment was conducted. </br>
		Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working on this project and in this team.

    <p>In this assessment, our team are trying to figure out are Surface virtual keyboard and standard keyboard have the likely result when people are typing the same content. During the experiment, all of the experimenter is coming from AUT who is learning BCIS. 
		One of difficulty is: it is hard to know is the handedness has any effect in our experiment. In real world, most people are right-handed. Hence, all the experimenter is right-handed in our experiment. 
		After the experiment, I learned compare with Surface virtual keyboard most people can type much quicker on the standard keyboard. In our experiment, we want our experimenter to have some basic typing skills, not a typing master or a layman. This would make data more dependable.
		Afterall, I'm really enjoy choosing this project in this semester. As a software student, I can bring all I learned into another class called research and development. It is my pleasure to join in this team, the other three team members help me a lot. This is an enjoyable project.</p>
